      In fancy they pursue <br>
      The dream-child moving through a land <br>
      Of wonders wild and new, <br>
      In friendly chat with bird or beast-- <br>
      And half believe it true." <br>

    <p>This emoji translation was a difficult process. Some words don't have an emoji to match with and some words don't match perfectly with the emoji's, but I had to try my best. Some words were paired with a very literal emoji, such as the word "I" was paired with an eye emoji. Some emoji's stand for the same word, such as "think" and "wonder."

  <p><span style="font-size:60px"> Down, </span> <span style="font-size:30px"> Down, </span> down.</p>

  <p> &#9940; &#128078; &#128103; &#128483;&#65039;</p>

  <p>There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.</p>

  <p> &#128049; &#9996;&#65039; &#128532; &#127756; &#128065;&#65039; &#129300;</p>

  <p>"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!"</p>

  <p> &#128049; &#128008; &#128049;</p>

  <p>(Dinah was the cat.)</p>

  <p>&#128065;&#65039; &#128591; &#128104;&#8205;&#128105;&#8205;&#128103; &#129335;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039; &#128103; &#129371; &#127861; &#9201;&#65039;</p>

  <p>"I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.</p>

  <p>&#128049; &#128065;&#65039; &#129310; &#128073; &#11015;&#65039; &#128103; &#10060; &#128001; &#127788;&#65039; &#128561; &#128073; &#129357; &#129415; &#128001; &#128073; &#128077;</p>

  <p>Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know?</p>

  <p>&#128008; &#128523; &#129415; &#129335;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039;</p>

  <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>&#128071; &#128103; &#128164; &#128694;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039; &#128483;&#65039; &#128173; &#128008; &#128523; &#129415;</p>

  <p>And here alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, "Do cats eat bats?</p>

  <p>&#128008; &#128523; &#129415; &#128008; &#128523; &#129415; &#128073; &#128064; &#128103; &#9940; &#9742;&#65039; &#10067; &#9940; &#129335;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039; &#128070; &#128072; &#128071; &#128103;</p>

  <p>"Do cats eat bats?" and sometimes, "Do cats eat bats?" for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.</p>

  <p>&#128103; &#128400;&#65039; &#128103; &#128564; &#128173; &#128103; &#128694;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039; &#128107; &#128049; &#128483;&#65039; &#128544; &#128049; &#128172; &#128103; &#129320; &#128073; &#128523; &#129415; &#128556; &#128266; &#128266;</p>

  <p>She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, "Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?" when suddenly, thump! thump!</p>

  <p>&#11015;&#65039; &#128103; &#128465;&#65039; &#127883; &#127810; &#10549;&#65039; &#128683;</p>

  <p>Down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>
